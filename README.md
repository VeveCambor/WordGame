# WordGame

## Joy of React, Project I

In this project, we'll recreate a popular online word game, Wordle:

![Demo showing the finished product, our Wordle clone](docs/wordle-demo.gif)

In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.

There were 5 exercises in the assignment which the project followed. 
I've enjoyed the whole process, I've tweaked the game design a bit and I still have two more challenges to extend the game: 
- visual keyboard and restart button.
